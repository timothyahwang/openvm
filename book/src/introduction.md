# OpenVM

_A performant and modular zkVM framework built for customization and extensibility_

OpenVM is an open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) framework focused on modularity at every level of the stack. OpenVM is designed for customization and extensibility without sacrificing performance or maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Modular no-CPU Architecture**: Unlike traditional machine architectures, the OpenVM architecture has no central processing unit. This design choice allows for seamless integration of custom chips, **without forking or modifying the core architecture**.

- **Extensible Instruction Set**: The instruction set architecture (ISA) is designed to be extended with new custom instructions that integrate directly with the virtual machine. Current extensions available for OpenVM include:

  - RISC-V support via RV32IM
  - A native field arithmetic extension for proof recursion and aggregation
  - The Keccak-256 and SHA2-256 hash functions
  - Int256 arithmetic
  - Modular arithmetic over arbitrary fields
  - Elliptic curve operations, including multi-scalar multiplication and ECDSA signature verification, including for the secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves
  - Pairing operations on the BN254 and BLS12-381 curves

- **Rust Frontend**: ISA extensions are directly accessible through a Rust frontend via [intrinsic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_function), providing a smooth developer experience.

- **On-chain Verification**: Every VM made using the framework comes with out-of-the-box support for unbounded program proving with verification on Ethereum.

## Security Status

As of June 2025, OpenVM v1.2.0 and later are recommended for production use. OpenVM completed an external [audit](https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/blob/main/audits/v1-cantina-report.pdf) on [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/) from January to March 2025 as well as an internal [audit](https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/blob/main/audits/v1-internal/README.md) by members of the [Axiom](https://axiom.xyz/) team during the same timeframe.
